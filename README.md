## üåü Overview

RootCoder-Vibe Coding is the first **AI-native IDE crafted specifically for iPhone and iPad**. Built with the latest SwiftUI patterns and iOS 18 visual design, RootCoder combines a tactile editing experience with an autonomous AI coding companion capable of understanding your project, manipulating files safely, and delivering complete features on the go.

- **Mobile-first power** ‚Äì Full-featured code editing, project navigation, and AI pair-programming optimized for multi-touch, Apple Pencil, and Stage Manager.
- **Autonomous AI Agent** ‚Äì Inspired by the Cline architecture with a continuous `while(true)` planning loop, sequential tool execution, and explicit completion signals.
- **Per-project RAG** ‚Äì Intelligent context retrieval scoped to each project using semantic search, dependency analysis, and token budgeting.
- **Production-grade pipelines** ‚Äì Seamless artillery between mobile ideation and desktop deployment with cloud sync and secure gateways.

> Build anywhere. Iterate anywhere. Ship anywhere ‚Äî directly from your iPhone or iPad.

## ‚ú® Product Highlights

| Experience | Why it matters |
|------------|----------------|
| **AI-first IDE** | Conversational coding with live tool execution, automated diffs, and precise file edits. |
| **iOS 18 design language** | Glassmorphism, material gradients, and fluid motion deliver a modern, premium workspace. |
| **Touch-native editor** | Gesture-driven selection, pinch-to-zoom previews, and Apple Pencil annotations keep you in flow. |
| **Instant context** | Smart Context (RAG) pulls in the most relevant files per query‚Äîno manual copy/paste. |
| **Run-anywhere projects** | Manage Swift, JS/TS, Python, and web stacks with project-aware templates. |
| **Offline-first UX** | Local semantic embeddings and caching let you stay productive without perfect connectivity. |

## üß† Technical Advantages

### Autonomous AI Engine
- **Cline-style agent loop**: Continuous reasoning until `attempt_completion` is triggered; no hard-coded depth limits.
- **Sequential tool execution**: Ensures safe file operations (create ‚Üí edit ‚Üí verify) with deterministic ordering.
- **Per-tool streaming UI**: Real-time tool progress indicators and structured output rendering.

### Project-aware RAG
- **Isolated context** per project path (`CodeIndexer.projectIndexCache[projectPath]`).
- **Dependency graph** caching (`DependencyAnalyzer.dependencyGraphCache[projectPath]`) to surface related files.
- **Token budgeting** (8K / 16K plans) with intelligent truncation for large codebases.

### Cloud & Gateway Integrations
- **CodePro gateway** with server-managed model routing (Anthropic Claude 4.5, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini).
- **Quota intelligence**: Dynamic switching between premium and free models based on usage (20K ‚Üí 15K threshold).
- **Test harness**: Built-in shell scripts for gateway validation and diagnostics.

### Secure-by-design
- On-device semantic search (Apple NLEmbedding).
- iCloud-backed quota sync to prevent abuse and ensure continuity.
- No sensitive model credentials stored client-side.

## üì± Crafted for iPhone & iPad

| Platform | Delightful details |
|----------|-------------------|
| **iPhone** | Quick Actions on Dynamic Island, one-handed chat-driven coding, and haptic-coded feedback loops. |
| **iPad** | Stage Manager multi-window layout, split-view file comparison, and Apple Pencil inline annotations. |
| **Universal** | 120Hz ProMotion-ready animations, accessibility support (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type), and seamless handoff to desktop. |
